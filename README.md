# A. Sales Performance Analysis

In **early 2014**, sales begin low, reflecting the typical post-holiday decline seen in **January and February**. As consumer spending picks up, sales rise steadily until **May**, likely driven by spring promotions. The summer months of **June to August** show a predictable drop, consistent with a shift in consumer focus toward vacations and travel.

Sales rebound in **November and December of 2014**, aligning with holiday shopping trends. This pattern repeats in **2015** and **2016**, with clear peaks during the holiday season and declines in early **January** and mid-year. Notably, **late 2017** shows the highest sales spike yet, marking a successful holiday period.
